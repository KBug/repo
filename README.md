# Catch-up TV AU Repository for XBMC/Kodi

We're maintaining a repository of XBMC/Kodi add-ons for Australian content, including most free-to-air Catch-up TV services and others like AFL and NRL.

Installation
------------
First step is the grab the [repo ZIP file][download].

Simply download the ZIP file to your XBMC/Kodi device and install through the menu via:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file.

The Kodi wiki has a good [walk-through guide to installing ZIP files][installzip] if you get stuck.

Once the repository ZIP file is installed, you can install the individual add-ons through the XBMC/Kodi Add-on manager:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Catch-Up TV AU -> Select the add-on category -> Select the add-on -> Install

The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on [installing Add-ons via the Add-on manager][addonmanager].

Issues
------
For any issues or bug reports, please file them on the [issues page][issues].
Please include log output, if possible. Follow the [log upload guide][logupload] and include the URL it gives you in your bug report.
